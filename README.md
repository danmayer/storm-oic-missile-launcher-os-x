__Ruby Missle Fire Assistant__

This is a simple OSX program to fire a USB storm nerf missle launcher

Eventually I could hook up CI or something to trigger this and I will likely create a little gem for it.


* For now you download the OSX missle launcher app
* Open the missle app
* 'unlock' the missle 'saftey'
* then `ruby test.rb`

Eventually I will have the code open the app if it isn't already running, and unlock the missle when it first opens the app. This was the quickest dirtiest solution I could come up with.
