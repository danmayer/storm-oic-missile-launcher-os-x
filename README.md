__Ruby Missile Fire Assistant__  
***

This is a simple OSX program to fire a USB storm nerf missile launcher

Eventually I could hook up CI or something to trigger this and I will likely create a little gem for it.

__First Time Setup__  
* For now you download the OSX missle launcher app  
* Open the missle app one  
* click preferences, disable camera on startup  
* then `ruby test.rb`  

__Normal Usage After Setup__  
* run `ruby test.rb`  

This is a I don't care do what you want with it kind of for the LULz software.
